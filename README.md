# Atom Tools for Editors

Toolset to assist in the editing and creation of text documents in [Atom](https://atom.io/). Current grammars include:

- Asciidoc
- HTMLBook
- Markdown (limited to bold/italic/style remover)

Features include:

- MS-word style bold/italic commands
- Remove text styles command
- Useful class wrappers
- ..._and much, much more!_

**Note:** Right now these are to be added to your atom config files; I may make this a package at some point.

I've mapped some of the commands to keys that I think make sense, and I've included a _keymap.cson_ file which you can use should you also find them sensible and useful. Otherwise, all commands can be accessed by using the command pallet (Cmd + Shift + P).
